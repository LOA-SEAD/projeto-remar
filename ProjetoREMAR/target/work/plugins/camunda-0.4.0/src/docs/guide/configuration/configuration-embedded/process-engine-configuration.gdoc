You can fully control your *embedded* camunda process engine configuration via Config.groovy:

{code}
camunda {
  engine {
    configuration {
      ...
    }
  }
}
{code}

Find a full specification of the values possible in the camunda docs for the spring [process
engine configuration|http://docs.camunda.org/latest/api-references/javadoc/org/camunda/bpm/engine/spring/SpringProcessEngineConfiguration.html].

Note that in case you do not configure a value the plugin relies on the default values coming
with the camunda engine in use - with the following three exceptions for the default grails
environments *dev*elopment and *test*:

- your database is populated with camunda tables the first time the database is accessed
- any *.bpmn (and for legacy reasons *.bpmn20.xml) process definitions found in the classpath will be deployed to the database
- the job executor is turned on

{note}This choice was made in order to make it as easy as possible to [get
started|guide:get-started] while relying on explicit configuration choices when deploying to
other (and potentially production) databases.{note}

That means if you want to have that same behaviour for any other environment, you need to
explicitely configure that in Config.groovy:

{code}
camunda {
  engine {
    configuration {
      databaseSchemaUpdate = true
      deploymentResources = ['classpath:/**/*.bpmn', 'classpath:/**/*.bpmn20.xml']
      jobExecutorActivate = true
    }
  }
}
{code}

Obviously you can also change the configuration for the environments development and test, for
the sake of the example e.g. to the current camunda defaults used for the grails environment
*prod*uction:

{code}
camunda {
  engine {
    configuration {
      databaseSchemaUpdate = false
      deploymentResources = []
      jobExecutorActivate = false
    }
  }
}
{code}

{note} Please be aware that during integration test phase of any environment, two camunda
configuration values are set by the plugin: the camunda job executor is turned off and service
mocking is made available. Find more information about that in section
[testing|guide:testing].{note}
