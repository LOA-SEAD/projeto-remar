You can set the [deployment
scenario|http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#introduction-architecture-overview-camunda-bpm-platform-architecture]
for your process engine. The plugin currently supports the deployment scenarios 

- '*embedded*' the process engine is embedded into your grails application and started and stopped with your grails application lifecycle
- '*shared*': the process engine is shared, so preconfigured within and managed by your container 
- '*none*': the process engine configuration and startup is turned off

{code:groovy}
camunda {
  deployment.scenario = "embedded" // (or "shared", "none")
}
{code}

{note}
As long as you do not set this value explicitely, the plugin assumes for grails' environments @dev@ 
and @test@ the value 'embedded' to be the default scenario, *for all other environment the value 
'shared'* (except if you have provided explicit @camunda.engine.configuration@ values for an embedded 
engine in which case 'embedded' remains default for other environments, too). The moment you 
set this value explicitely, the plugin of course won't interfere anymore!
{note}

The moment you set the value explicitely, the plugin won't interfere with your decision. However,  
{note}

Typically, you will want to use the 'shared' engine only for those grails environments which you 
use to prepare your container deployment war, e.g. 'production': 

{code:groovy}
environments {
    production {
        camunda {
            deployment {
                scenario = "shared"
            }
        }
    }
}
{code}

{note}
Currently the plugin only supports *tomcat* as a container to look up a shared process engine. Download 
camunda BPM *Tomcat* distribution.
