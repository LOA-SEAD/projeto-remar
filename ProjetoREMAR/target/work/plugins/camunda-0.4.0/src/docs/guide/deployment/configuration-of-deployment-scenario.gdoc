Does your application work with an 'embedded' or a 'shared' process engine?
 
Do you *either* want to use the engine just *behind the scenes* of your own 
custom grails application with your own forms, controllers, services etc? Then 
go for the embedded engine. *Or* do you want to use the camunda BPM platform 
'tasklist' with embedded forms and implement a grails based *process application* 
for it? Then go for the shared engine. In that case you will still want to use
an embedded engine for testing your application.

Now, *configure your [deployment scenario|guide:deployment-scenario] accordingly!*
Then move on with deploying your application according to your scenario.
