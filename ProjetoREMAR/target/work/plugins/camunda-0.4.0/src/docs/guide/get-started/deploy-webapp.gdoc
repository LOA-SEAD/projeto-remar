Do you want to see the *camunda BPM* tasklist and cockpit web apps *in action* with your 
freshly created process? Then download a *[camunda BPM|http://camunda.org/download/] distribution* 
for *tomcat*, expand the archive, go to the expanded folder and start it by issuing:
 
{code:bash}
./start-camunda.sh
{code}

Now, return to your your grails project command line, and create a 'war' file prepared to use
the process engine managed by the camunda BPM tomcat container and shared with your grails app:

{code:bash}
grails war
{code}

Move the war generated in your target folder into the camunda BPM tomcat 'webapp' folder. 
Open [http://localhost:8080/camunda-welcome|http://localhost:8080/camunda-welcome] and navigate 
to the tasklist application. Log in with user 'demo', password 'demo' and start your new process 
via the (little bit hidden :-) "start process" button in the top right corner:

!tasklist-dashboard-start-process.png!

The sample form shows you different types of fields. You must at least select one of the values
in the 'sampleRequiredSelectionField' in order to validate the start form and enable the 
"Start"-Button. Start the process and you should see the "Sample UserTask" of your process 
assigned to you as user "demo". You may want to check out the diagram pane of your process and then
complete the task via the form. This will execute the subsequent service task (which logs 
the process variables provided by you into your tomcats logs/catalina.out file) and immediately 
after that finish your process instance.
