You can automatically reload and redeploy '*.bpmn*' process definitions placed beneath 
'*grails-app/processes*'. When changing the process definition while you are running 
your application with '*run-app*', it will be redeployed to the process engine.

Also check the possibility to turn this feature on/off explicitely [by configuration|guide:auto-reload-configuration].
