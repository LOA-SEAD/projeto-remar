For testing purposes, you can (and must!) explicitely "drive" your process whenever it arrives at a "wait state".
Please review the discussion about [transactions in
processes|http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-engine-transactions-in-processes] to learn
more about that. Such a wait state is always reached for e.g. user tasks, but with the job executor turned off in
particular also for service tasks marked to be [continued
asynchronously|http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-engine-transactions-in-processes-asynchronous-continuations]:

{code:xml}
<serviceTask id="myServiceTask" ... camunda:async="true">
...
</serviceTask>
{code}

In such a case you must now mimic the work of the background job executor and explicitely tell the process to
"move on" with execution, e.g. by writing:

{code}
def job = managementService.createJobQuery().processInstanceId(pid).singleResult()
managementService.executeJob(job.id)
{code}
