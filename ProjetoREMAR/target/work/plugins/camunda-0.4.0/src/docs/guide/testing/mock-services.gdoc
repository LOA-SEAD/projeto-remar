You can call services from within your process via [JUEL|http://juel.sourceforge.net] expressions, like e.g.

{code}
<serviceTask id="myServiceTask" camunda:expression="#{sampleTestProcessService.serviceMethod(execution)}" ... >
...
</serviceTask>
{code}

For your tests, instead of calling your actual service 'sampleTestProcessService' you can call a mock, like e.g.

{code}
def sampleTestProcessService = Mock(SampleService)
org.camunda.bpm.engine.test.mock.Mocks.register("sampleService", sampleTestProcessService)
{code}

This will make sure that the juel identifier 'sampleService' will be resolved to the mock instance,
provided you use the
[MockExpressionManager|http://docs.camunda.org/latest/api-references/javadoc/org/camunda/bpm/engine/test/mock/MockExpressionManager.html]
for resolving your JUEL expression identifiers - which is what the plugin will make sure for Grails' integration test
phase.
