Therefore you need to make a conscious choice about whether to turn on/off the 'grails.logging.jul.usebridge'
setting in your Config.groovy. See the information about the performance impact on
[http://www.slf4j.org|http://www.slf4j.org/legacy.html#jul-to-slf4j].

*In case the bridge is not turned off explicitely by you, the plugin will turn it on for all Grails test phases.*
However, your explicit choice won't be overridden. 

{note}This decision in particular makes sure that the bridge is turned on for tests executed in the default Grails
environment '*test*', for which no explicit setting is made in the default grails application. As soon as you make
an explicit decision for any of your default or custom environments, the plugin won't interfere anymore.{note}
