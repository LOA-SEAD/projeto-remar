{note}Beware that this test will populate your test environment database with camunda related
tables. By default, this will be a H2 in memory database preconfigured by Grails - so everything
fine with that. For other databases, you will need to adapt the [plugin
configuration|guide:alternative-database], too.{note}

{code:bash}
grails test-app integration: org.camunda.my.TestProcess
{code}

When executing the test you should see the following familiar output :-)

{code:bash}
| Running 1 integration test... 1 of 1
| Completed 1 integration test, 0 failed in 0m 0s
| Tests PASSED - view reports in ./target/test-reports
{code}

*Congrats!* You are successfully using an embedded camunda BPM engine with the Grails framework!
If you want to use camunda "behind the scenes" of your grails app that's all that is needed! But
maybe you ...
