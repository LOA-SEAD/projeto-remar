In your BuildConfig.groovy configure the following plugin dependency:

{code:xml}
plugins {
    compile \":camunda:0.4.0"
}
{code}

You may want to refresh your dependencies now in order to make sure that Grails properly
installs the plugin. Type on your command line

{code:bash}
grails refresh-dependencies
{code}
