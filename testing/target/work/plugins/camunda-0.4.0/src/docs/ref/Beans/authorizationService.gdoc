h2. Bean 'authorizationService'

You can use the *[org.camunda.bpm.engine.AuthorizationService|http://docs.camunda.org/latest/api-references/javadoc/org/camunda/bpm/engine/AuthorizationService.html]* as an injectable bean:

{code}
def authorizationService
{code}

The plugin registers the bean as 'camundaAuthorizationServiceBean' with the default alias 'authorizationService'.
You can change this default alias via [configuration|guide:bean-names].
