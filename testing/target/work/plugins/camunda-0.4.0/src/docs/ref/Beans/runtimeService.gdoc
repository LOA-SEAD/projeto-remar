h2. Bean 'runtimeService'

You can use the *[org.camunda.bpm.engine.RuntimeService|http://docs.camunda.org/latest/api-references/javadoc/org/camunda/bpm/engine/RuntimeService.html]* as an injectable bean:

{code}
def runtimeService
{code}

The plugin registers the bean as 'camundaRuntimeServiceBean' with the default alias 'runtimeService'.
You can change this default alias via [configuration|guide:bean-names].
